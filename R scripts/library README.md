#about libraries  

I am lazy, and therefore do not want to write my code in nice portable R markdown until it is close to final, and I do not want to include an install function for every library I use in every bit of code. so, I provide a library script with a pacman to install all used libraries. Once this is closer to final, then the scripts will be updated to work independently
